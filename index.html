Steal raw zucchini off kitchen counter ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box, refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am. I cry and cry and cry unless you pet me, and then maybe i cry just for fun then cats take over the world,</p>
