                <p>I am an avid Linux user and love the customizability so much that I change up my desktop every month or so. This subpage basically functions as some kind of gallery of these desktops.<br>Feel free to right click an image and view it in a new tab in order to zoom in.</p>
                <details><summary><b>First Desktop - Nov 2022</b></summary><p>So, basically the first customization I made in Linux. Looking back at it, it looks pretty bad haha. Still, this workflow of a top bar and a bottom bar: It has been kept for a long time.</p><img src="firstdesktop.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Layan - Dec 2022</b></summary><p>Started using the Layan theme - Also put in a "start menu" thats similar to the fullscreen start menu I used back in Windows10.</p><img src="layan.png"><img src="layanstartmenu.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Firewatch Valley - Apr 2023</b></summary><p>Played around a lot with the colours. Also made myself this menu on the side of the screen which I was very proud of.</p><img src="firewatchvalley.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Dark side of the Eevee - I forgor 2023</b></summary><p>Decided to try out a simple layout again - It's pretty similar to Windows. After using that one, I switched to Debian on xfce and used that for a while - in there, I had a similar layout.</p><img src="darksideoftheeevee.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Hexarchs - July 2023</b></summary><p>I use arch btw :); Went for a bit of a futuristic look. Looks fairly nice, but I honestly dont like the workflow with this bottom dock if I'll be honest.</p><img src="hexarchs.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>The Refugee - July 2023</b></summary><p>Ok now this: I didn't know Kwin had a tiling manager built in. What I did is that I grabbed Latte Dock and made transparent docks on all sides of the screen so that it looks like theres this border for tiled windows. Other than that, really proud of that desktop, it looks awesome.</p><img src="refugee1.png"><img src="refugee2.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Catppuccin - Sep 2023</b></summary><p>I became more of an avid Linux user by using a theme such as "Catppuccin".</p><img src="catppuccin.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Catppuccin x KwinTiling - Oct 2023</b></summary><p>Wait a minute, you're telling me Kwin has a tiling manager built in?????</p><img src="catppuccinkwintiling.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Twilight Light Tower - Oct 2023</b></summary><p>Essentially the same workflow as before, except this time with a dynamic theme between light and dark!<br>Screenshot taken in Minecraft at <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/wuhu-island---wii-sport-resort-island/">this majestic recreation of Wuhu Island from Wii Sports Resort</a>! (I put in a hyperlink to the world on planetminecraft)<br>Seriously, check it out. It's good. Shaders are the BSL shaders or whatever they're called. My computer hates me :)</p><img src="twilight-light.jpg"><img src="twilight-dark.jpg"></details>
                <details><summary><b>Bonus: Windows 10 - Oct 2023</b></summary><p>This is not a drill.<br>I do rarely use Windows 10 (I installed it on a second, smaller SSD next to Arch btw) and I felt a bit funny. So I riced Windows. Yes, the Windows 10. Kind of insane.</p><img src="windows10-oct23.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>i3 - Nov 2023</b></summary><p>So i started using i3.<br>Wallpaper is a modified version of a photo I took at around "44° 45' 26.7408'' N 14° 45' 31.7808'' E"</p><img src="i3.png"></details>
                <details><summary><b>light - Mar 2024</b></summary><p>Been using KDE again for longer. Just not going crazy on desktops. One day I just felt so bored and decided to light mode on everything. really happy with the results</p><img src="light.png"></details>
