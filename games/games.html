                    <p>Nowadays I mainly play on Java. Often just with friends, rarely Singleplayer anymore. Ingame name - devcey</p>
                    <p>But yes, I've played Minecraft for as long as I can remember. A lot on the time was on the Wii U for some reason too. Still on the search for some people I met there years ago :)</p>

                    <p>By the time of writing this I only have 4 C-Sides (3, 5, 7 and 8) left and the moon berry. My reaction to beating Farewell was insane :)</p>

                    <summary><b>Hollow Knight</b></summary>
                    <p>Hear me out. I suck at this game. I sucked at it so much I quit it. I stopped somewhere in that crystal cave. I still do appreciate the game a lot since it's very well made. I just love Indie games :)<br>I tried following Hornet's advice of "git gud" but I still failed.<br>Also hear me out - Silksong releases August 20th 2024 because I said so.</p>
