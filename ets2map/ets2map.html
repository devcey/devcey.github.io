                <h1>Metro Map for ETS2</h1>
                <p>I wanted to make a map for Euro Truck Simulator 2 based on my old creative mode world in Minecraft Wii U Edition for a long time. Everytime I got into it, I got frustrated with something. Let's try it again and hopefully not get frustrated :)</p>
