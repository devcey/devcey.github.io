        <h1>Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I like a buncha stuff.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Videogames</h2>
        <p>Yup. Videogames. Although I probably seem weird to other people who play a lot of them because.. I don't
            really play many of the shooters or games that really popular right now. Nor do I play games from
            AAA-Studios that much. Indie games hold a special place in my heart.</p>
        <p>Some of my favourite games include Terraria, Euro Truck Simulator 2, Minecraft and a buncha other games. I
            really like platformers like Celeste aswell. I also believe that games like Hollow Knight are really well
            made and I am genuinely excited for Silksong (it will never release) but I doubt I'll ever play it: I just
            had too much trouble with the first game because my skills aren't that good. haha</p>
        <p>I also don't see myself playing new games that often, although there are a bunch of games I am excited for in
            the next while. One I am really excited for is Cities: Skylines 2, but I am also kind of scared of it
            because who knows how it will be compared to the first game?</p>
        <p>Oh, also I love playing those with friends. Just a little evening spending time with Stick Fight or Don't Starve or whatever else there exists. It's always a good time</p>
        <p>TL;DR: Videogames were a major part of my childhood and I still love to spend time playing those...</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Music</h2>
        <a href="music.html">so this exists</a>
        <p>But hey, I also have this neat <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/73Ptbo9GJSdnEhJPv7wSFG">Spotify playlist</a> with too many songs. I always add in new stuff in there.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Linux</h2>
        <p>I first got into contact with Linux around September 2020. I was fed up with Windows for a moment, so I was looking for alternatives... stumbled upon Linux.</p>
        <p>My first ever distro that I used was Ubuntu 20.04. I had a little dual boot set up with Windows and Linux for a while, until I realized I found myself more often on Windows because of videogames... I uninstalled Ubuntu.</p>
        <p>It doesn't end there. I still experimented a lot in virtual machines.</p>
        <p>Then we arrive at the November 2022 incident. Windows updates: You know 'em, right? Yeah, so uh... one of them kind of destroyed my Windows installation. I had a ton of issues before so I just decided "nah, I'll do a full switch NOW" (I already planned to possibly switch when I was getting a new PC)</p>
        <p>Distrohopped a bit through debian and Fedora until finding rest at Kubuntu. I love Linux now, one of my favourite things include how it takes up less storage space than Windows and the <a href="desktop">customizabilty</a>. I can imagine switching to another distro in the future (I'd love to try out something that is a rolling release) but for a while I have been sticking to Kubuntu.</p>
        <p>Later in June 2022 I switched to debian. I've been trying out the MATE desktop environment (I did not like it that much) and afterwards the xfce desktop environment (which I fairly like, but I prefer KDE)</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Other things I sometimes do</h2>
        <p>I often just chill in a Discord server with my friends. It's a nice time there. That's basically how almost all my time at my PC is spent.</p>
        <p>Also I sometimes draw. My profile picture on Discord is often digital art of my own character. I also have some acryl paintings that I made in my room. Pretty fun to do sometimes.</p>
        <p>Oh and this. Y'know, dev. But I barely do so, and when I do, I mostly just drop it after a week. oops. Also it just me or is the font terrible on that subpage?</p>
